# InternationalWagesManager Overview
>This project aims to solve the problem of managing employee salaries that are composed of three different currencies. In this scenario, the employer is located in one country, the employee in another, and the wage rate is fixed according to the currency of a third country. The employer needs to keep track of how much is owed to the employee based on the currency that they pay with, and this requires accounting for the exchange rate at the end of each working month. Additionally, the employee incurs expenses that need to be translated to the employer's currency, again based on the exchange rate. This project seeks to create a system that can accurately manage these complex currency exchanges, ensuring that both employer and employee are compensated fairly and efficiently.
